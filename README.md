# HPL-and-STREAM
HPL and STREAM (synthetic benchmarks)

This test involves running HPL (version 2.3) and STREAM (version 5.10). 

Single node benchmarking results for both HPL and STREAM must be provided for 

- CPU nodes
- GPU nodes
- High Memory nodes

For HPL, additionally, the (projected) results for 

- an interconnnect island
- the full solution

should be supplied.

Please confirm MPI version, library versions and compiler options used, and include your 'HPL.dat' file in your response.

As part of acceptance testing, we will be verifying the submitted results; results measured on the delivered cluster must be within 10% of the submitted values.
